# Projects

I studied Electrical & Systems Engineering, involving biomedical data & systems. I experienced in managing of large-scale systems development projects & using data tools for data analytics, and i enjoy applying my skills to help people to solve everyday problems using technology. I believe learning is a never ending process as continuous learning is important to grow and develop new skills to keep pace with technology.
